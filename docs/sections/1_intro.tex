In this paper, we want to present and analyze four algorithms designed to sort arrays efficiently. The chosen algorithms are:

\begin{itemize}
    \begin{samepage}
        \item{Quicksort, in which the randomized variant will also be briefly discussed}
    \end{samepage}
    \begin{samepage}
        \item{Quicksort 3 way partitioning, an extension of Quicksort that highlights its efficiency when sorting arrays with duplicate elements}
    \end{samepage}
    \begin{samepage}
        \item{Counting sort, which differently from the others is a non-comparison-based algorithm}
    \end{samepage}
    \columnbreak
    \begin{samepage}
        \item{Timsort, an hybrid algorithm used in modern software systems}
    \end{samepage}
\end{itemize}

Each algorithm will be examined in detail through their key features and eventually their limitations, and then implemented in C programming language. Their complexity will be shown using benchmarks we also elaborated.
